Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke has introduced a transformative hiring policy that prioritizes artificial intelligence (AI) over human recruitment. In an internal memo titled "AI usage is now a baseline expectation," Lütke stated that managers must prove AI cannot perform a task before requesting to hire new employees. This policy reflects Shopify's strategic shift toward integrating AI across all aspects of its operations, including employee performance reviews, prototyping processes, and day-to-day tasks.

Key Points from the Memo
AI Proficiency as a Core Expectation: Employees are required to use AI tools extensively, with proficiency in AI being assessed during performance and peer reviews.

AI-First Hiring Policy: Teams must justify why AI cannot handle a role before seeking approval for new hires. Lütke framed this approach as "hire an AI before you hire a human".

Enhanced Productivity: Lütke emphasized that AI can multiply productivity by tenfold and believes it is crucial for Shopify's continued growth and innovation.

Executive Accountability: The policy applies to all levels of the organization, including the executive team and Lütke himself.

Broader Implications
This policy signals a significant shift in employment practices, raising concerns about job security for existing employees. Workers who fail to adopt AI tools effectively may be labeled as underperformers, potentially risking replacement by automated systems. Additionally, marketing teams and other departments are likely to face increased scrutiny due to advancements in AI capabilities such as content generation and data analysis.
