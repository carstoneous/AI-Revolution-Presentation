AI-First Hiring: Shopify’s Policy and Other Companies’ Approaches
Shopify: “Use AI First” Before Adding Headcount


Shopify’s signage at its Ottawa headquarters. CEO Tobi Lütke has mandated an “AI-first” approach – encouraging employees to use AI tools before expanding teams. In late March 2025, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke sent an internal memo to staff (which he later shared publicly on X/Twitter) outlining a new hiring policy in the age of AI. Teams must first attempt to accomplish their goals using artificial intelligence tools before requesting approval to hire additional people. In Lütke’s words, “Before asking for more headcount and resources, teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI. What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team? This question can lead to really fun discussions and projects.”​

 The memo effectively makes AI the first “new teammate” to consider for any task at Shopify, rather than automatically defaulting to adding human staff. Lütke provided context that this AI-first expectation is now a “fundamental expectation” across Shopify’s workforce​

. He noted that embracing AI has been a “multiplier” of productivity for employees who use it, enabling some to tackle previously implausible tasks at 100× output through “brilliant usage of AI,” according to Lütke​

. In fact, he indicated Shopify will even factor employees’ AI usage into performance reviews going forward​

. This underscores how serious the company is about leveraging AI internally. The overall message from Shopify’s CEO is clear: exhaust AI solutions first – only if a job truly “cannot get done using AI” should hiring more people be on the table​

Klarna: Hiring Freeze Thanks to AI (CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski)
Another company taking a similar stance is fintech firm Klarna. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski has explicitly credited AI advancements as a reason to halt new hiring. In a December 2024 Bloomberg interview, Siemiatkowski declared, “I am of the opinion that AI can already do all of the jobs that we as humans do. It’s just a question of how we apply it and use it.”​

 This bold statement underpinned Klarna’s decision to stop hiring new employees for an entire year. In that period, Klarna’s headcount dropped from about 4,500 to 3,500 purely through attrition, since “by not hiring, we’re simply shrinking” the workforce, Siemiatkowski explained​
businessinsider.com
. The practical effect is that Klarna will only add a human role if it’s proven that AI or automation truly cannot handle the work. In Siemiatkowski’s view, most tasks can be handled by AI – for example, Klarna’s customer-service chatbot performs the work of 700 human agents​

. He even suggested that, thanks to AI efficiencies, Klarna’s staff could eventually shrink to just 2,000 (from 4,000+), with savings redistributed as higher salaries for remaining employees​

. Klarna’s approach, led from the top, is effectively to use AI wherever possible instead of hiring. The CEO’s directive forces every team to consider if a human hire is truly necessary or if an AI system could do the job.
IBM: Pausing Hiring for Roles AI Might Do (CEO Arvind Krishna)
Large enterprise companies are also adopting “AI-before-hiring” policies. In May 2023, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna announced a pause on hiring for certain support roles as the company pivots to automation. Krishna told Bloomberg that IBM “expects to pause hiring for [some] roles” because roughly 7,800 jobs – especially back-office functions like HR – could be replaced by Artificial Intelligence in the coming years​

. In other words, IBM will not fill many non-customer-facing positions going forward, assuming AI and automation will handle a significant portion of that workload. Krishna estimated that around 30% of such roles could be replaced by AI within five years​
reuters.com
. This stance has been translated into policy by slowing or suspending recruitment in those areas. Essentially, IBM is mandating automation first: if AI can do the job, the company would prefer not to hire a new person. For roles like administrative and HR tasks – for example, processing employment verification letters or moving employees between departments – IBM is investing in AI to perform the work instead of adding staff​

. This top-down policy signals to managers that any request to expand headcount must be justified against the capability of AI to do that same work. IBM’s approach illustrates how even established companies are rethinking workforce growth in light of AI’s rapid improvements.
BT Group: Automation to Reduce Future Hiring (CEO Philip Jansen)
Outside of the tech/fintech sphere, telecom giant BT Group (British Telecom) provides a clear example of an executive explicitly planning for AI to replace the need for new hires. In May 2023, BT announced it will cut tens of thousands of jobs by 2030 as it rolls out fiber networks and AI-driven automation. CEO Philip Jansen stated the company will “be a beneficiary of AI unequivocally,” and as a result, by the end of the 2020s BT will rely on a much smaller workforce with a significantly reduced cost base​

. In particular, Jansen estimated that about 10,000 roles out of the 55,000 job cuts planned could be replaced by AI and digital processes​

​

. Many of these are customer service and network maintenance positions that BT believes can be handled by AI systems (such as chatbots like “Amy” that already handle customer inquiries) and other automation technologies​
techinformed.com
. While this is a long-term reduction rather than an immediate hiring rule, it effectively means BT will not be hiring into those functions as it automates them. Jansen’s message highlights that across industries, from tech to telecom, executives are explicitly prioritizing AI solutions over adding personnel for efficiency gains.
Comparison of AI-First Hiring Stances
The table below compares several companies’ policies or executive stances that require leveraging AI or automation before approving new hires. It lists the company, a summary of the policy or approach, a pertinent quote from the CEO/executive, and the source of the statement:
Company	AI-First Hiring Policy	Executive Quote	Source
Shopify (E-commerce)	Teams must prove that AI tools can’t accomplish a task before requesting a new hire or more resources. This was instituted as a company-wide policy in 2025.	“Before asking for more headcount… teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.” – Tobi Lütke, CEO​

Klarna (Fintech)	Hiring freeze due to AI – stopped hiring new staff for a year, letting AI handle work. Will only hire if absolutely necessary because AI “teammates” are doing most jobs.	“AI can already do all of the jobs that we as humans do. It’s just a question of how we apply it and use it.” – Sebastian Siemiatkowski, CEO​

IBM (Technology)	Paused hiring in areas that AI could replace. Especially for back-office roles (HR, etc.), automation is pursued instead of adding staff. Plan anticipates thousands of jobs will be done by AI.

BT Group (Telecom)	Limiting workforce through AI. Long-term plan to cut ~55k jobs by 2030, with ~10k of those roles replaced by AI/automation. New hiring in those areas will be minimal as technology takes over.	“By the end of the 2020s BT Group will rely on a much smaller workforce and significantly reduced cost base.” – Philip Jansen, CEO​

.
Each of the above cases demonstrates an executive-driven mandate to consider AI or automation as the first solution before growing headcount. Shopify’s internal memo formally requires it, and other CEOs have taken actions (freezing hiring, declaring hiring pauses, or planning staff cuts) based on the premise that AI can often do the work of additional employees. The trend spans industries – from software and finance to telecom – reflecting a broader shift in how organizations evaluate productivity and workforce needs in light of rapid advances in AI.
