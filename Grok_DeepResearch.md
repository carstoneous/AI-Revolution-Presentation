Conducted on April 10, 2025, this report synthesizes extensive research to provide a detailed overview, including industry trends and implications.
Background on Shopify's Policy
On April 7, 2025, Tobi Lutke, CEO of Shopify, shared an internal memo via an X post, outlining a significant shift in the company's hiring approach. The memo, titled "AI usage is now a baseline expectation," mandates that teams must demonstrate why AI cannot fulfill required tasks before requesting additional headcount or resources. Lutke emphasized that AI is a "fundamental expectation" for all employees, describing it as a "multiplier" of productivity that enables tackling previously implausible tasks and achieving up to 100X work output. This policy is integrated into performance reviews, with AI proficiency becoming a key evaluation criterion.

Shopify's context includes recent workforce adjustments, with headcount decreasing from 8,300 to 8,100 by December 2024, following layoffs of 14% in 2022 and 20% in 2023. This backdrop underscores the company's focus on AI to maintain efficiency, especially as tech firms invest heavily in AI, with megacaps spending over $300 billion in 2025, and 152,000 roles cut across 549 tech companies in 2024 TechCrunch: Shopify CEO tells teams to consider using AI before growing headcount.
Identification of Companies with Similar Stances
Research suggests several companies are adopting strategies akin to Shopify's, prioritizing AI to reduce workforce needs, though their approaches vary. Below is a detailed examination:
Klarna: The Swedish fintech company has been vocal about using AI to replace human workers, particularly in customer service and marketing. Reports from August 2024 indicate Klarna reduced its workforce from 5,000 to 3,800 through natural attrition and plans to further cut to 2,000 employees. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski highlighted that AI, such as chatbots, now performs tasks previously handled by 700 employees, reducing customer issue resolution time from 11 minutes to 2 minutes while maintaining satisfaction. This strategy, driven by partnerships with OpenAI, aims to enhance efficiency, with revenue per employee increasing from $400,000 to $700,000, and the company achieving a 27% revenue increase to 13.3 billion Swedish krona in H1 2024 BBC News: Klarna: AI lets us cut thousands of jobs - but pay more, Reuters: Sweden's Klarna says AI chatbots help shrink headcount.

BlueFocus: A Chinese marketing agency, BlueFocus has replaced external copywriters and designers with generative AI since April 2023, halting spending on third-party creative staff. CEO Pan Fei's statements in June 2024 indicate that 36% of employees spend over three hours daily on AI, with the company achieving 43% revenue growth in 2023 to 52.61 billion RMB. Pan predicts that half of digital marketing work and positions will be replaced by AI, reflecting a "human + AI" working mode Campaign Asia: BlueFocus CEO: Half of digital marketing work and positions will be replaced by AI, Technology Org: Jobs That AI Has Already Replaced.

Best Buy: In 2023, Best Buy implemented a restructuring plan, eliminating thousands of jobs in customer service and corporate roles, and invested in AI-driven systems developed with Google Cloud and Accenture. AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants now handle customer inquiries, leading to a 12% reduction in operating costs and a 15% increase in customer satisfaction due to improved response times Forbes: Musk Replacing Workers with AI: Should You Be Worried?.

Google and Microsoft: While not explicitly stating a policy like Shopify's, both companies have reduced workforces while investing heavily in AI. Google laid off hundreds from its ad sales team in 2024, with CEO Sundar Pichai referencing the "profound moment with AI" in a memo, indicating a focus on AI-driven efficiency CBS News: Tech companies are slashing thousands of jobs as they pivot toward AI. Microsoft, investing billions in OpenAI, also cut jobs, aligning with AI expansion, though specific hiring policies are less documented [Ibid.].

Industry Trends and Broader Context
The World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report, published in January 2025, surveyed hundreds of large companies and found that 41% plan to reduce their workforces by 2030 due to AI automation, a shift from the 2023 report's optimism about net job creation. Additionally, 77% of companies plan to reskill or upskill existing workers to collaborate with AI, highlighting a dual strategy of workforce reduction and enhancement CNN Business: Artificial intelligence: 41% of companies worldwide plan to reduce workforces by 2030 due to AI. This trend is evident in tech layoffs, with 152,000 roles cut across 549 companies in 2024, reflecting a broader industry pivot toward AI Fortune: Shopify CEO tells employees no new hires unless they can prove AI canâ€™t do the job.
Implications and Challenges
Adopting AI before hiring offers benefits such as increased efficiency, cost savings, and access to advanced capabilities. For instance, Shopify aims to tackle implausible tasks, while Klarna reports higher revenue per employee. However, challenges include potential job displacement, ethical concerns, and the need for upskilling. Companies must balance AI integration with maintaining human expertise, as AI may lack nuanced judgment in creative or strategic roles.
